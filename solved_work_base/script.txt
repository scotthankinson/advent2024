As the puzzle solver, read puzzle.txt and input.txt to develop a comprehensive plan to solve the puzzle.  Format the plan using Markdown and display it here for review before writing it.

That looks good.  Write that as Solution.md to the Solution folder.  Then copy input.txt to the Solution folder.

As the Software Engineer, read Solution.md to understand how to solve the puzzle in Typescript.  

Next read input.base.ts and use that as a model to come up with Typescript code to implement the solution.  Display it here before writing it, leaving part2 empty for now.

Go ahead and write the solution

You previously solved the puzzle by reading puzzle.txt and input.txt to produce solution.md -- read over those to refresh your memory and we will attempt to solve puzzle2.txt

Yes, and copy it to your output folder.

As the Software Engineer, review Solution1.md and Solution2.md to refresh yourself on the solution approach to our current puzzle

Read the solution to part 1 in index.ts and identify where the solution to part 2 should be added

Can you implement part 2?
