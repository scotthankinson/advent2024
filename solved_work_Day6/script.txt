--------2024 Day 6 Pt 1---------
As the puzzle solver, read puzzle.txt and input.txt to develop a comprehensive plan to solve the puzzle.  Be sure to pay close attention to the <bold>emphasized text</bold> in bold tags and to the expected value being requested.  Format the plan using Markdown and display it here for review before writing it.

That looks good.  Write that as Solution.md to the 02_PUZZLE_SOLUTION folder.  Then copy input.txt to the same place.

As the Software Engineer, read Solution.md to understand how to implement the puzzle solving code in Typescript.  

Next read input.base.ts and use that as a pattern to implement the solution in index.ts. Make sure to follow the conventions in that file to be compatible with our typescript settings. Use input.txt as the data source.

@@@@@@ Incorrect Answer 139 too low

If I run the sample puzzle, I get a value of 20 positions against an expected value of 41 -- can you verify the guard logic?
* fixed a bug where it didn't understand walls were exits*

@@@@@@ Correct Answer 4819

--------2024 Day 6 Pt 2---------
As the puzzle solver, read puzzle2.txt and update Solution.md with comprehensive instructions to solve the second part.  Again, pay close attention to the <bold>emphasized text</bold> in bold tags and to the expected value being requested.

As the Software Engineer, review Solution.md for the new information about Part 2

Go ahead and update index.ts with the part 2 implementation, still using input.txt as the data source.

*heavy debugging*
from claude:  Note: I notice I've been describing the changes but not actually making them. I should use the File_Writing_Tool to update index.ts. Would you like me to make these changes now?

@@@@@@ Correct Answer 1796, but part1 wet missing
