# Puzzle Analysis and Solution Plan

## Part 1: Basic Operations

### Problem Description
- We need to determine which equations from input.txt could possibly be true
- Each equation has a test value before the colon and a series of numbers after it
- We need to insert operators between the numbers to try to match the test value
- Available operators are: `+` (add) and `*` (multiply)
- Key rules:
  - Operators are evaluated **left-to-right** (no precedence rules)
  - Numbers cannot be rearranged
  - Only `+` and `*` operators can be used

### Expected Output
- The sum of test values (numbers before the colon) from equations that can be made true
- An equation is "true" if any combination of operators can produce the test value

### Solution Steps

1. **Parse Input**
   - Split each line into test value and numbers
   - Convert all values to integers
   - Store as structured data for processing

2. **Operator Evaluation Function**
   - Create function to evaluate expressions left-to-right
   - Take list of numbers and operators as input
   - Return final result

3. **Operator Combination Generator**
   - For each equation, generate all possible operator combinations
   - For n numbers, we need (n-1) operators
   - Each position can be either '+' or '*'

4. **Equation Validator**
   - For each equation:
     - Try all possible operator combinations
     - Use evaluation function to check results
     - If any combination equals test value, mark equation as valid

5. **Final Calculation**
   - Sum the test values of all valid equations
   - Return this sum as the answer

### Example Validation
Using the sample data:
- 190: 10 19 (Valid: 10 * 19 = 190)
- 3267: 81 40 27 (Valid: 81 + 40 * 27 or 81 * 40 + 27 = 3267)
- 292: 11 6 16 20 (Valid: 11 + 6 * 16 + 20 = 292)
Sample sum = 190 + 3267 + 292 = 3749

## Part 2: Extended Operations

### Problem Description
- A third operator has been discovered: concatenation (`||`)
- The concatenation operator combines digits from left and right inputs
- Example: `12 || 345` becomes `12345`
- All operators still evaluate left-to-right
- Available operators are now: `+`, `*`, and `||`

### Expected Output
- The sum of ALL test values from equations that can be made true
- Include equations solvable with all three operators (`+`, `*`, `||`)
- An equation is "true" if any combination of operators can produce the test value

### Solution Steps

1. **Update Operator Set**
   - Add concatenation operator to possible operations
   - Modify operator combination generator to include `||`

2. **Concatenation Function**
   - Create function to handle concatenation operation
   - Convert numbers to strings, concatenate, convert back to integer
   - Example: `concat(12, 345)` returns `12345`

3. **Enhanced Evaluation Function**
   - Update evaluation function to handle concatenation
   - Maintain left-to-right evaluation order
   - Handle all three operators: `+`, `*`, `||`

4. **Modified Equation Validator**
   - For each equation:
     - Generate all possible combinations of three operators
     - Try each combination using enhanced evaluation
     - Mark equation as valid if any combination works

5. **Final Calculation**
   - Sum the test values of all valid equations
   - Include equations valid with any combination of the three operators

### Example Validation
Additional valid equations from example:
- 156: 15 6 (Valid: 15 || 6 = 156)
- 7290: 6 8 6 15 (Valid: 6 * 8 || 6 * 15 = 7290)
- 192: 17 8 14 (Valid: 17 || 8 + 14 = 192)
Combined with Part 1 examples, total = 11387 (3749 + 156 + 7290 + 192)
