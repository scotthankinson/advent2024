# Puzzle Analysis and Solution Plan

## Part One: Initial Program Analysis

### Problem Overview
- We're working with a 3-bit computer simulation
- The computer has three registers (A, B, C) that can hold any integer
- Program consists of 3-bit numbers (0-7)
- Need to determine program output when run with given initial register values

### Initial State
- Register A: 48744869
- Register B: 0
- Register C: 0
- Program: 2,4,1,2,7,5,1,3,4,4,5,5,0,3,3,0

### Key Components

#### Instruction Set (8 instructions)
1. adv (0): Division of A by 2^operand → A
2. bxl (1): XOR of B with literal operand → B
3. bst (2): operand mod 8 → B
4. jnz (3): Jump if A≠0 to literal operand position
5. bxc (4): XOR of B and C → B
6. out (5): Output (operand mod 8)
7. bdv (6): Division of A by 2^operand → B
8. cdv (7): Division of A by 2^operand → C

#### Operand Types
1. Literal: Value is the operand itself
2. Combo: Special interpretation
   - 0-3: Literal values 0-3
   - 4: Value in register A
   - 5: Value in register B
   - 6: Value in register C
   - 7: Reserved (invalid)

### Solution Steps
1. Initialize registers with given values
2. Process program instructions sequentially:
   - Read instruction pairs (opcode, operand)
   - Execute according to instruction rules
   - Track instruction pointer
   - Collect all outputs from 'out' instructions
3. Join all outputs with commas
4. Return final string

### Expected Output Format
- A comma-separated string of numbers
- Each number will be between 0-7 (3 bits)

## Part Two: Self-Replication Analysis

### Systematic Testing Results

#### Best Performing Bit Groups
1. Group 8 (bits 24-26):
   - Values 010, 100, 110 achieved 13/16 matches
   - Controls early program flow

2. Group 9 (bits 27-29):
   - Values 001, 101 achieved 13/16 matches
   - Influences middle sequence generation

3. Group 11 (bits 33-35):
   - Value 101 achieved 13/16 matches
   - Critical for output sequence alignment

4. Group 12 (bits 36-38):
   - Value 101 achieved 13/16 matches
   - Affects program termination conditions

5. Group 13 (bits 39-41):
   - Value 110 achieved 13/16 matches
   - Important for sequence completion

### Pattern Analysis

#### Mathematical Properties
1. Division Patterns
   - Numbers must survive specific divisions by powers of 2
   - Key divisions occur at predictable intervals
   - Final divisions must align with program termination

2. XOR Operations
   - Create cyclic bit patterns
   - Must maintain 3-bit boundaries
   - Critical for sequence generation

3. Output Generation
   - Most frequent patterns: "1,4,7,0", "1,4,1,0", "7,4,1,0"
   - Patterns repeat at regular intervals
   - Influenced by register state transitions

### Refined Search Strategy

1. Focus Areas
   - Target specific bit group combinations
   - Maintain division-friendly structures
   - Ensure XOR pattern compatibility

2. Number Properties
   - Must be divisible by powers of 2
   - Must contain specific bit patterns in key groups
   - Should generate consistent 3-bit outputs

3. Implementation Approach
   - Test combinations of successful bit patterns
   - Verify division properties
   - Validate XOR operation results
   - Check output sequence alignment

### Validation Criteria
1. Must generate program sequence: 2,4,1,2,7,5,1,3,4,4,5,5,0,3,3,0
2. Must be smallest possible positive number
3. Must terminate properly through divisions
4. Must maintain register state consistency

### Next Steps
1. Implement targeted testing of bit pattern combinations
2. Verify mathematical relationships between successful patterns
3. Test candidate numbers against full program execution
4. Validate results against all criteria
