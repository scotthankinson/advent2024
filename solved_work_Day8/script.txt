As the puzzle solver, read puzzle.txt and input.txt to develop a comprehensive plan to solve the puzzle.  Be sure to pay close attention to the <bold>emphasized text</bold> in bold tags and to the expected value being requested.  Format the plan using Markdown and display it here for review before writing it.

That looks good.  Write that as Solution.md to the 02_PUZZLE_SOLUTION folder.  Then copy input.txt to the same place.

As the Software Engineer, read Solution.md to understand how to implement the puzzle solving code in Typescript.  

Next read index.base.ts and use that as a pattern to implement the solution in index.ts. Make sure to follow the conventions in that file to be compatible with our typescript settings. Use input.txt as the data source.

As the puzzle solver, read puzzle2.txt and update Solution.md with comprehensive instructions to solve the second part.  Again, pay close attention to the <bold>emphasized text</bold> in bold tags and to the expected value being requested.

As the Software Engineer, review Solution.md for the new information about Part 2.  Update index.ts with the part 2 implementation (while leaving the part 1 implementation intact).  Continue to use input.txt as the data source.

** I had to take the reigns on part2 as it struggled and went back to distance calcs, but the real solution was only a few lines**
    Q: I think you were overthinking it -- I've added the correct solution to index.ts. Were the things I could have queued you with the part2 solution to better arrive at this result?
    A: Yes, looking at how I approached it versus the actual solution, I see several things that could have helped me arrive at the correct solution more efficiently:
        * Reuse of Existing Logic: I should have recognized that the vector-based approach from part 1 could be extended directly - if inverting the vector once works for part 1, extending it multiple times would work for part 2.
        * Pattern Recognition: The sample showing that antinodes form at regular intervals along the vector line should have suggested a simpler solution - just extend the same vector pattern rather than creating new complex line-drawing logic.
        * Problem Similarity: Part 2 is essentially the same problem as part 1 but without the 2:1 distance restriction - it's an extension rather than a completely different approach.
        * Over-engineering: I added unnecessary complexity with separate functions for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines when the vector math already handled all these cases implicitly.
        * Solution Hints: The fact that part 1 used integer vector math successfully should have suggested that the same approach would work for part 2.
