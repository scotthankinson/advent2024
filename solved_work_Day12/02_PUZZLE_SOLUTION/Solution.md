# Puzzle Solution Plan

## Problem Analysis
- Input is a large grid of letters where each letter represents a plant type
- Need to identify distinct regions of connected same-letter plots
- Must calculate area and perimeter for each region
- Final answer is sum of all region prices (area × perimeter)

## Solution Steps

1. **Grid Processing**
   - Convert input string into 2D grid
   - Handle newlines to maintain proper grid structure
   - Create data structure to store grid coordinates

2. **Region Identification**
   - Implement flood-fill algorithm to find connected regions
   - Track visited cells to avoid double-counting
   - For each unvisited cell:
     - Start new region
     - Expand to adjacent same-letter cells
     - Store coordinates of each region

3. **Region Calculations**
   - For each identified region:
     - Calculate area (count of cells in region)
     - Calculate perimeter:
       - Count external edges (not touching same letter)
       - Check all four sides of each cell
       - Add to perimeter if adjacent cell is different letter

4. **Price Calculation**
   - For each region:
     - Multiply area by perimeter to get region price
   - Sum all region prices for final answer

## Validation
- Test against example cases from puzzle description:
  - First example (4x4 grid) should total 140
  - Second example (5x5 grid) should total 772
  - Third example (10x10 grid) should total 1930

## Implementation Notes
- Need careful edge detection for perimeter calculation
- Must handle regions that may wrap around others
- Important to avoid double-counting shared boundaries
- Should implement efficient region tracking to handle large input

# Part 2 Solution Plan

## Problem Analysis
- Same input grid and region identification as Part 1
- Key difference: Instead of using perimeter length, use number of sides
- A side is a straight section of fence, regardless of length
- Must carefully count sides for regions with holes (like the A-shaped region example)
- Inside and outside of fence sections don't connect across gaps

## Solution Steps

1. **Region Identification** (reuse from Part 1)
   - Use same flood-fill algorithm to find connected regions
   - Keep same region tracking system

2. **Side Counting Algorithm**
   - For each region:
     - Trace the boundary of the region
     - Count each distinct straight line segment as one side
     - For regions with holes:
       - Count outer boundary sides
       - Count inner boundary sides separately
       - Ensure diagonal connections don't create false sides

3. **Side Detection Rules**
   - A side starts when:
     - Direction changes (horizontal to vertical or vice versa)
     - Region boundary is interrupted by different letter
   - Handle special cases:
     - Regions with holes (like the A-shaped region with 12 sides)
     - Diagonal adjacencies (don't connect across them)

4. **Price Calculation**
   - For each region:
     - Calculate area (same as Part 1)
     - Count total number of sides
     - Multiply area × number of sides
   - Sum all region prices for final answer

## Validation
- Test against example cases:
  - First example (4x4 grid) should total 80
  - Second example (O and X grid) should total 436
  - E-shaped region example should total 236
  - A-shaped region example should total 368
  - Larger example (10x10 grid) should total 1206

## Implementation Notes
- Critical to handle regions with holes correctly
- Must track direction changes to count sides properly
- Need to ensure diagonal adjacencies don't create false connections
- Important to count inner boundaries as separate sides
- Special attention needed for regions that wrap around others
