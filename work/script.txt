As the puzzle solver, read puzzle.txt and input.txt to develop a comprehensive plan to solve the puzzle.  Format the plan using Markdown and display it here for review before writing it.

That looks good.  Write that as Solution.md to the Solution folder.  Then copy input.txt to the Solution folder.

As the Software Engineer, read Solution.md to understand how to solve the puzzle in Typescript.

Go ahead and write the solution.
