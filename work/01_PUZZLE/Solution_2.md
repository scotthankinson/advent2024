# Solution Plan for Puzzle 2: Problem Dampener Analysis

## Problem Understanding
- Part Two introduces the Problem Dampener module
- Allows reactor safety systems to **tolerate a single bad level**
- Need to recount safe reports with this new rule

## Key Rules
1. Original safety rules still apply:
   - Levels must be monotonic (all increasing or all decreasing)
   - Adjacent differences must be 1-3 inclusive

2. New Problem Dampener Rule:
   - If removing ANY single level would make an unsafe report safe
   - Then that report counts as safe
   - It's like the bad level "never happened"

3. Example Analysis:
   ```
   7 6 4 2 1: SAFE (naturally safe, no removal needed)
   1 2 7 8 9: UNSAFE (no single removal fixes 5-jump)
   9 7 6 2 1: UNSAFE (no single removal fixes 4-jump)
   1 3 2 4 5: SAFE (removing 3 makes it safe)
   8 6 4 4 1: SAFE (removing one 4 makes it safe)
   1 3 6 7 9: SAFE (naturally safe, no removal needed)
   ```

## Solution Steps
1. Reuse Original Safety Check
   - Keep function from Part 1 to check natural safety

2. Create Problem Dampener Function
   - For each report:
     - If naturally safe, count it
     - If unsafe:
       - Try removing each level one at a time
       - Check if any resulting sequence is safe
       - If any attempt succeeds, count as safe

3. Process All Reports
   - Apply both checks to each report
   - Keep running total of safe reports

4. Return Result
   - Output the **total count of safe reports** including:
     - Naturally safe reports
     - Reports made safe by Problem Dampener

## Expected Output
- A single integer representing total safe reports under new rules
- Example shows 4 safe reports out of 6 (up from 2 in Part 1)

## Implementation Notes
- Need to handle all possible single-level removals
- Original safety check can be reused
- Must check each position for removal
- Example shows safety can be achieved by removing middle numbers
