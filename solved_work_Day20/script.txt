As the puzzle solver, read puzzle.txt and input.txt to develop a comprehensive plan to solve the puzzle.  Be sure to pay close attention to the <bold>emphasized text</bold> in bold tags and to the expected value being requested.  Format the plan using Markdown and display it here for review before writing it.

That looks good.  Write that as Solution.md to the 02_PUZZLE_SOLUTION folder.  Then copy input.txt to the same place.

As the Software Engineer, read index.base.ts to get a sense for how we should structure our code to solve the puzzle.  Next read Solution.md to understand how to implement the puzzle solving code in Typescript.  Using index.base.ts as a pattern, implement the solution in index.ts. Make sure to follow the conventions in that file to be compatible with our typescript settings. The puzzle input should be read from input.txt.

As the puzzle solver, read puzzle2.txt and update Solution.md with comprehensive instructions to solve the second part (as a new section that does not modify the fist part).  Again, pay close attention to the <bold>emphasized text</bold> in bold tags and to the expected value being requested.

As the Software Engineer, we correctly solved Part 1.  Let's now review Solution.md for the new information about Part 2.  Update index.ts with the part 2 implementation (while leaving the part 1 implementation intact).  Continue to use input.txt as the data source.
