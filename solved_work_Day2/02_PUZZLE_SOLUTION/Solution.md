# Puzzle Analysis and Solution Plan

## Part 1: Basic Safety Analysis

### Problem Definition
- We need to analyze reports from the Red-Nosed reactor
- Each report is a line of numbers representing levels
- Goal: Count how many reports are "safe"

### Safety Criteria
A report is considered safe if and only if BOTH conditions are met:
1. Levels must be either ALL increasing or ALL decreasing
2. Adjacent levels must differ by:
   - At least 1 (minimum difference)
   - At most 3 (maximum difference)

### Example Analysis (from puzzle.txt)
```
7 6 4 2 1 - SAFE (decreasing by 1-2)
1 2 7 8 9 - UNSAFE (increase of 5 between 2->7)
9 7 6 2 1 - UNSAFE (decrease of 4 between 6->2)
1 3 2 4 5 - UNSAFE (mixed direction: up->down->up)
8 6 4 4 1 - UNSAFE (no change between 4->4)
1 3 6 7 9 - SAFE (increasing by 1-3)
```

### Solution Algorithm (Part 1)
1. Read each line from input.txt
2. For each line:
   a. Split into array of numbers
   b. Check direction (increasing or decreasing)
   c. Verify adjacent differences (1-3)
   d. Count if both conditions are met

### Implementation Steps (Part 1)
1. Parse input file line by line
2. For each line:
   - Convert string to array of integers
   - Check if sequence is monotonic (all increasing or all decreasing)
   - Verify adjacent differences are within bounds
   - Track valid count
3. Output final count of safe reports

## Part 2: Problem Dampener Enhancement

### New Feature: Problem Dampener
- A reactor-mounted module that can ignore one bad level in an otherwise safe report
- If removing any single level would make an unsafe report safe, the report counts as safe
- Original safety rules still apply when checking if a sequence is safe

### Updated Example Analysis
```
7 6 4 2 1 - Safe (no removal needed)
1 2 7 8 9 - Still unsafe (no single removal helps)
9 7 6 2 1 - Still unsafe (no single removal helps)
1 3 2 4 5 - Safe (by removing 3)
8 6 4 4 1 - Safe (by removing one 4)
1 3 6 7 9 - Safe (no removal needed)
```

### Enhanced Solution Algorithm (Part 2)
1. First check if sequence is safe using Part 1 rules
2. If unsafe, for each position in the sequence:
   a. Create a new sequence with one number removed
   b. Check if the new sequence is safe using Part 1 rules
   c. If any removal creates a safe sequence, count the original as safe
3. Count total safe sequences (including both naturally safe and dampener-assisted safe)

### Implementation Steps (Part 2)
1. Reuse Part 1's safety checking function
2. For each unsafe sequence:
   - Try removing each number one at a time
   - Check if any resulting sequence is safe
   - If any variation is safe, count original as safe
3. Output new total of safe reports

### Testing Strategy
1. Validate against new example cases
2. Additional edge cases to consider:
   - Sequences where removing middle numbers helps
   - Sequences where removing end numbers helps
   - Sequences where multiple removals could work (count as safe)
   - Verify original safe sequences remain safe
   - Check boundary cases with minimum sequence length
