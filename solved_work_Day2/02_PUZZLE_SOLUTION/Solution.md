# Puzzle Analysis and Solution Plan

## Problem Understanding
1. We're analyzing reactor safety reports where each report is a line of space-separated numbers (levels)
2. The puzzle has two parts with different safety criteria

### Part 1 - Basic Safety Rules
A report is considered safe if:
- Levels are either all increasing OR all decreasing
- Adjacent levels must differ by at least 1 and at most 3

### Part 2 - Problem Dampener Rules
- Adds ability to tolerate a single bad level
- If removing any single level makes an unsafe report safe, the report counts as safe
- All other rules from Part 1 still apply

## Required Steps

1. **Data Processing**
   - Read input data (each line is a report)
   - Parse each line into lists of numbers
   - Handle empty lines or invalid input

2. **Safety Check Functions**
   - Create function to check if numbers are strictly increasing/decreasing
   - Create function to verify adjacent number differences (1-3)
   - Create function to check if a report is safe (Part 1)
   - Create function to implement Problem Dampener logic (Part 2)

3. **Part 1 Solution**
   - Process each report through basic safety checks
   - Count total number of safe reports
   - Expected output: A single number (was 334 in example)

4. **Part 2 Solution**
   - Process each report through enhanced safety checks with Problem Dampener
   - For unsafe reports, try removing each number once to check if it becomes safe
   - Count total number of safe reports
   - Expected output: A single number

## Implementation Notes
- Need to handle edge cases (single number reports, empty reports)
- Optimize Problem Dampener checks to avoid unnecessary processing
- Ensure proper validation of input data
