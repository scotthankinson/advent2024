# Puzzle Analysis and Solution Plan

## Problem Overview
- We have stones arranged in a **straight line**
- **Each stone has a number** engraved on it
- The stones change simultaneously according to specific rules when we "blink"
- We need to determine **how many stones will exist after 25 blinks**

## Initial Input
```
9694820 93 54276 1304 314 664481 0 4
```
(8 initial stones)

## Transformation Rules (In Priority Order)
1. **Rule 1**: If stone number is 0 → Replace with 1
2. **Rule 2**: If stone number has even digits → Split into two stones (left half digits and right half digits)
3. **Rule 3**: Otherwise → Multiply number by 2024

## Implementation Plan

1. **Data Structure Setup**
   - Create a list/array to store stone numbers
   - Ensure numbers are stored as strings to easily count digits
   - Maintain order as specified

2. **Rule Processing Function**
   - Input: Single stone number
   - Process rules in priority order:
     - Check for zero
     - Check for even number of digits
     - Apply multiplication if no other rules match
   - Output: Array of resulting stone(s)

3. **Blink Processing Function**
   - Input: Array of current stones
   - Process each stone simultaneously
   - Collect all results into new array
   - Return new stone arrangement

4. **Main Loop**
   - Start with initial input array
   - Perform 25 blink iterations
   - Track stone count after each blink
   - Return final stone count

## Expected Output
- A single integer representing the total number of stones after 25 blinks

## Validation Steps
1. Verify rule application order
2. Test with example cases:
   - Single stone transformations
   - Multiple stone arrangements
   - Edge cases (0, single digits, large numbers)
