I've implemented the optimized solution with the following key features:

Core Data Structure:
    Uses Map<string, number> to store stone values and their counts
    Significantly reduces memory usage by consolidating duplicate stones
Cycle Detection:
    detectCycle function identifies repeating patterns in stone transformations
    Uses state serialization to compare states efficiently
    Includes safety limit to prevent infinite loops
Optimized Processing:
    processBlinkMap handles transformations using the Map structure
    Processes unique stones only once, applying counts to results
    Maintains all original rules but with better performance
Progress Monitoring:
    Logs cycle detection information
    Reports progress every 10 blinks when not using cycles
    Includes error handling and informative console output
Flexible Solution:
    Works for both part 1 (25 blinks) and part 2 (75 blinks)
    Falls back to direct calculation if no cycle is found
    Maintains type safety with TypeScript interfaces and types

The solution should now be significantly faster than the chunking approach, especially for part 2. The code will:

First attempt to detect a cycle in the stone transformations
If a cycle is found, calculate the final state using cycle properties
If no cycle is found, fall back to direct calculation with progress logging

Key advantages of this approach:

Space Efficiency:
    Stores only unique stone values
    Consolidates duplicate stones into counts
    Much smaller memory footprint than array of all stones
Time Efficiency:
    Once we detect a cycle, we can skip processing remaining iterations
    Map operations are O(1)
    No need to process all 75 iterations if we find a pattern
Pattern Detection:
    Automatically identifies repeating patterns in stone transformations
    Uses cycle detection to optimize calculation
    Similar to Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm concept
Scalability:
    Would work efficiently even with much larger iteration counts
    Memory usage based on unique stones, not total stones
